# About The Project


Codewars is a community of developers, who are called Code Warriors (or just warriors), that train on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice.



# Key Concepts
There are a few important concepts that you should be aware of.

**Kata**

In our dojo, kata are code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. They are the main activity performed on the site. Some of these challenges train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Others are puzzles meant to test your creative problem solving, while others are based on real world coding scenarios.


**Ranks**

Ranks are used to indicate progression and difficulty. Code Warriors complete Kata which are assigned a rank, which in turn earns them a higher rank once they complete enough of them. There are two classes of ranks, Kyu and Dan. You begin with Kyu at level 8 and work your way down to level 1. Then you progress to Dan, where you work your way up from level 1 to level 8.

**Honor**

Honor represents the level of respect a user has earned from the community, based on their skill and contributions. While ranks are an indication of your skill only, honor is an indication mostly of your activity and contributions.

**Privileges**

Your privileges are what control the actions you can take on the Codewars site. The longer you use the site, the more privileges you are given. For example, being able to create kata or higher voting power. You gain privileges as a result of how many honor you have. Privileges are not based on rank, however, users with a higher rank are more likely to have more honor points.



## Kata Ranking


## White (Beginner)


**8 Kyu**

8 kyu kata represent a beginner level. At this level the kata is only challenging for users new to programming. This includes programming tasks such as:

* Defining a simple function (i.e. hello world)
* Basic variable assignments
* Fixing basic syntax issues
* Trivial algorithms such as basic if/else statements


**7 Kyu**

7 kyu kata represent a beginner programming level. At this level the kata will generally challenge users on their core language and API reference knowledge. Tasks such as:

* Iterating arrays and returning a subset of values
* Basic data type manipulations
* Basic functional or object-oriented concepts
* Basic Regular Expressions
