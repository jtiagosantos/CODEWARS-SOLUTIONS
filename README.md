# About The Project


Codewars is a community of developers, who are called Code Warriors (or just warriors), that train on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice.



# Key Concepts
There are a few important concepts that you should be aware of.

**Kata**

In our dojo, kata are code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. They are the main activity performed on the site. Some of these challenges train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Others are puzzles meant to test your creative problem solving, while others are based on real world coding scenarios.
